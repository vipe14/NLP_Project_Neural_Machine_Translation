**Neural Machine Translation (NMT) from English to Marathi** : 
This GitHub repository hosts a project focused on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) from English to Marathi. NMT is a prominent application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that leverages deep learning models to automatically translate text from one language to another.

**Project Overview** : 
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust and efficient NMT system that can translate English text into Marathi. The repository contains the necessary code and resources to facilitate the development, training, and evaluation of the translation model.

**Features** : 

Data Preparation: Includes guidance on acquiring and preprocessing parallel English-Marathi text data for training.

Model Training: Offers scripts and utilities to train NMT models using various architectures like RNN, LSTM, GRU, or Transformer. Customization options for hyperparameters and training strategies are available.

Inference: Provides a script for translating English sentences to Marathi using the trained models.

Evaluation: Offers tools for assessing the translation quality using metrics like BLEU, METEOR, or ROUGE.


**Contribution** : 
We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and NLP enthusiasts. If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow the standard GitHub workflow:
      Fork the repository.
      Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
